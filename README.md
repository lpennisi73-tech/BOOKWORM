## 🎯 Philosophy

Just like a **bookworm** methodically digests complex texts to extract their essence, BOOKWORM transforms complicated open source technologies into simple, user-friendly tools.

> **Our mission: Make the complex, simple.**

## 🌟 The Journey

Open source is powerful but often intimidating. Advanced technologies like kernel compilation, VPN configuration, or system administration require deep expertise that creates barriers for newcomers and even experienced users seeking efficiency.
